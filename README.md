# ‚ö°Ô∏è Delphi Ntfy 

Delphi Ntfy it's a friendly library to work with [ntfy.sh](https://docs.ntfy.sh/) endpoints in Delphi. It allows you to publish messages and subscribe to topic channels to receive those same messages. It's pretty similar to a websocket used to push instant notifications.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

You can add ```src``` folder to your library path or search path. Or you can simply use boss dependency manager to install

``` cmd
  boss install github.com/p-samuel/delphi-notify
```

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

Create a message notification to a specif topic(channel). The topic's name you choose will become a public url, so remember to make it difficult to guess it.

``` pascal

uses
  Notify;

begin

  Ntfy.Notification(
    New.Notification
      .Topic('your-very-secret-topic')
      .Title('üê∂ Parking with dog')
      .MessageContent('Today at 16:00hs ') 
  );

  Ntfy.Publish;

end;

```

# üí¨ Subscribe to a topic

You can subscribe to a topic through several ways. For instace, the [Web App](https://ntfy.sh/app), [Android](https://docs.ntfy.sh/subscribe/phone/), [CLI](https://docs.ntfy.sh/subscribe/cli/) or you can use the [VCL Sample](https://github.com/p-samuel/delphi-notify/tree/main/sample/vcl). There is a demonstration in the VCL samples showing you how to use Delphi Ntfy into your project.

``` pascal

uses
  Notify;

begin

  Ntfy.Subscribe('your-very-secret-topic');

end;

```
